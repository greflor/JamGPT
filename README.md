# JamGPT
Connecting Arduino with OpenAI 

This was my hons project in 4th year. It connects an Arduino with physical inputs & outputs to OpenAI's chatGPT API for some interesting interactions. As more advanced APIs come out for AI such as vision, text to speech, image creation and so on, using arduino to interface with the will be very useful. 

Hello, the Code is very messy and I don't know if it will work. 

I used an Arduino Nano 33 IoT which saved me a lot of hastle 
It needs a 2.4GHz signal otherwise it won't connect. 
If using an iPhone hotspot, select "maximise compatibility" and this will change the signal from 5GHz to 2.4 

Please get in touch if you have any questions!
